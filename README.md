Multi-Threaded Client-Server MIS

This project is my Multi-Threaded Client Server Machine Instruction Simulation Project. In here, I have a pdf that contains what the task of this project is.

To compile and run type in:
make
make client

This will create a server executable and a client executable. Open up two terminals and in one run the server executable while in the other run the client executable.

If you would like, you can run multiple clients executables that hold different files and the same server executable and the program will still work.
